Python Libraries

1. Tensor Flow
->Data in tensor flow are represented as tensor, which are multidimensional arrays


Features
->Better computational graph visualization
->In neural machine translation, reduces error by 50-60%
->parallel computing to execute complex models
->seamless library management

Application 
->Speech/image recognition
->Text based application
->Time series
->Video detection


2. NUMPY
->General purpose array processing package
->Numpy is the fundamental package for numerical computation
with python, it contains a powerful N-dimensionalarray object


Features
-> Providesfast precomplied functions for numerical routines
->array oriented computing for better efficiency
->support object-oriented approach
->compact and faster computations with vectorization



Application
-> Extensively used in data analysis along with pandas
->Creating powerful N-dimensional array
->Forms he base of other libraries like scipy,scikit-learn
->replacement of matlab when used along with scipy and matplotlib


3.SCIPY - Scientific Python
->It provides many user-friendly and efficient routines for scientific computation, 
it extends Numpy


Features
-> A collection of mathematical algorithm and scientific fuynction
built on the numpy extension of python
->High Level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data
->Multi-dimensional image processing with scipy.ndimage
->Includes function for computing inregrals numerically,
solving differential equation, optimization, etc


Application
->Multi-dimensional image operation
->Solving differential equations and fourier transform
->Optimization algorithms
->Lnear algebra


4.Pandas
-> Python data analysis Library
->It provides fast, flexible and epressive data structure designed to work with
structures data easily and intuitively


Features
->Eloquent syntax and rich functionality
-> Apply() enables you to run a function across series of data
->High level abstraction
-> Contains high level data structure and manipulation toolss

Application
->General data wRangling
->ETL jobs and data storage
->Used in wide variety of academic and commercial
domains, including statistics etc
->Time series-specific functionality


5.Matplotlib
-> plotting library
->used for visualization
->It provides an object oriented API embedded plots into application

Features
-> AS usable as matlab with an advantage of being free and
open-source
-> Supports dozens of backends and other types
-> Pandas itself can b used ass Wrapper around matplotlib's API
-> Smaller memory consumption and better runtime behaviour

Appication
->Correlation analysis of variables
->visiualize 95% confidence intervals of the models
->Outlier detection
->visualizing distribution to gain instant insights
